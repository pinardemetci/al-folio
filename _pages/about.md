Bored <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritius">islander</a>, always trying to find a excuse to step on a plane in a perpetual quest for newness. Dad x3, trail runner, scuba diver and watercolour enthusiast in a past life...will get back to these one day.

Currently working as an Internet Measurement Expert at ISOC to untangle this giant web.  My areas of interest are Interdomain routing, network security, Internet measurements, content delivery and QoE, with a particular emphasis on African networks. I am a co-chair of the <a href="https://afrinic.net/committees/measurement-wg">AFRINIC Measurement Working Group</a>. On the side, I am a Research Committee member of the <a href="https://thegfce.org/">GFCE</a> and I am a frequent speaker at NOG meetings in Africa. I enjoy reviewing papers as a TPC member of several academic and technical conferences including ACM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), Traffic Measurement and Analysis (TMA), AFRICOMM, AFPIF, AIS, SAFNOG, etc.

I am currently completing a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. I obtained an M.Eng in Computer Engineering at Telecom Nancy, France (2008) and an MSc in Information Security at the University of London, UK (2013). Between 2008 and 2010, I worked as a Guest Researcher at NIST in the Information Discovery, Use and Sharing division, working in the field of Computational Biology, assisting researchers with software instrumentation.
